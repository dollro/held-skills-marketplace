description: Close the gap between a Claude Design spec and its implementation. Use when the user has exported screens from Claude Design (HTML or PNG) and wants Claude Code to compare them against a running frontend, produce a ranked delta report, and iteratively apply fixes until they match. Driven by a committed parity.config.yaml and a runtime adapter that detects Playwright MCP, Chrome DevTools MCP, or a bundled Node runtime. Triggers include "compare to the design", "match the spec", "design parity", "fix the differences from Claude Design", "why does my implementation not match the mockup", or when Claude Design HTML exports are present alongside a running dev server URL.

# Design Parity

## What this skill does

Close the gap between a Claude Design spec (target) and its implementation (actual) through a repeatable compare-and-fix loop. Produces a ranked delta report — not just pixel diffs — and applies fixes hierarchically (structure before style). The full run is driven by a single committed `parity.config.yaml`, so the same command works on a dev machine, in CI, and inside an MCP-assisted agent session.

## Core loop

```
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. Prepare target  (HTML → rendered PNG, or PNG as-is)   │
│  2. Screenshot impl (running dev server, same viewport)   │
│  3. Pixel diff      (odiff finds WHERE things differ)     │
│  4. Vision analysis (Claude explains WHAT and WHY)        │
│  5. Rank deltas     (by perceptual impact, not pixel count)│
│  6. Emit fix_plan   (operable edits, not advice)          │
│  7. Apply + re-run  (goto 2 until converged or accepted)  │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Every iteration writes to `.parity/runs/<screen>/iteration_N/`. The loop is resumable and reviewable.

## Prerequisites

1. **Target exports** — HTML (preferred; same rendering stack = fewer false positives) or PNG.
2. **A running dev server** reachable at the URL in `parity.config.yaml → base_url`.
3. **A `parity.config.yaml`** — scaffold with `parity init`. Never guess routes; the config is the contract.
4. **Viewport** — default `1440×900`. For PNG targets, viewport auto-matches the PNG dimensions unless `--strict`.

If anything is missing, ask one clarifying question. Do not guess routes.

## Runtime adapters

The skill dispatches browser ops through one of three adapters. Set in `parity.config.yaml → runtime:` (default `auto`):

|-|-|
| `auto` | detect: MCP playwright → MCP chrome-devtools → node-playwright |
| `node-playwright` | bundled Node runtime (needs local `npm install`) |
| `mcp-playwright` | emit an ordered MCP tool-call plan; the calling agent executes it |
| `mcp-chrome-devtools` | same, targeting Chrome DevTools MCP |

Signal MCP availability to the skill via env:

```bash
export PARITY_MCP_PLAYWRIGHT=1         # or PARITY_MCP_CHROME_DEVTOOLS=1
```

Stabilization steps (fonts, animations, lazy scroll, masks) are identical across adapters — they're expressed as an IIFE that each runtime runs as-is. See `references/runtimes.md`.

## Commands

```bash
parity init                       # scaffold config, rubric, .parity/.gitignore
parity auth                       # headless login per config.auth block
parity run [--screen <id>] [--strict]
parity plan [--screen <id>]       # emit MCP plan (for runtime: mcp-*)
```

All commands read `./parity.config.yaml` by default; override with `--config`.

## Config (excerpt)

```yaml
runtime: auto
base_url: http://localhost:3000
viewport: [1440, 900]
auth:
  mode: form                      # form | cookie | storage-state | none
  login_url: /login/
  fields:
    "#login-username": ${env:SS_EMAIL}
    "#login-password": ${env:SS_PASSWORD}
  success_match: "/\\/app\\//"
  storage_state: .parity/auth.json
screens:
  - id: dashboard
    path: /dashboard
    target: targets/dashboard.html
    requires_auth: true
  - id: settings
    path: /app/settings/
    target:
      html: targets/canvas.html    # multi-screen canvas export
      selector: "#settings-main [data-screen]"
    mask:
      - ".save-status-chip"
      - { region: [1100, 20, 140, 24] }
      - { text: "/\\d{1,2}:\\d{2}|ago|today/i" }
    requires_auth: true
fixtures:
  first-session:
    seed: node scripts/seed.mjs --user testuser --sessions 3
```

## Why HTML targets beat PNGs

When the target is a PNG, every "difference" is filtered through two different rendering stacks (Claude Design's vs. the user's browser). Font metrics, subpixel rendering, and DPR all diverge → false positives that aren't real bugs.

When the target is HTML, we render it in the **same browser, same viewport, same DPR** as the implementation. The only remaining differences are real. Always prefer HTML when available.

## Masks — three kinds

```yaml
mask:
  - ".save-status-chip"                         # selector shorthand
  - { selector: "[data-fresh-date]" }           # selector explicit
  - { region: [x, y, w, h] }                    # opaque rectangle overlay
  - { text: "/timestamp-regex/i" }              # replace matching text nodes with spaces
```

Regex-text masks are essential for "11:42 AM" / "2 hours ago" strings that change every run but aren't tied to a single selector.

## Fixture seeding

Some screens require populated data. Declare fixtures; they run before screenshots:

```yaml
fixtures:
  first-session:
    seed: node scripts/seed.mjs --user testuser --sessions 3
    path_params:
      session_id: ${env:FIXTURE_SESSION_ID}
    teardown: node scripts/seed.mjs --cleanup
```

Path templates (`/app/transcripts/{session_id}`) substitute `path_params` before navigation.

## Viewport / PNG-dim handling

- HTML target: viewport comes from config (default 1440×900).
- PNG target: viewport auto-matches the PNG dimensions. An explicit override is warned about, not blocked — unless `--strict`.
- Never resize the target or impl — interpolation poisons the diff.

## Vision analysis

Load `target.png`, `impl.png`, and `diff.png` into context. Apply the rubric (`references/rubric.md`, overridable via `parity.rubric.yaml`) in this order:

1. **Structure** — missing, extra, or miscontained elements.
2. **Layout** — positions, alignment, spacing, flex/grid order.
3. **Typography** — family, size, weight, line-height, letter-spacing.
4. **Color** — fill, border, shadow (ΔE threshold).
5. **Micro** — radius, shadow depth, iconography.

Write two files per iteration:

- `deltas.json` — ranked findings with category, severity, region, description.
- `fix_plan.json` — concrete `replace` / `patch` / `delete_lines` / `insert_after` / `note` ops an operator (human or agent) can apply directly. See `references/fix-plan.md`.

## Thresholds (defaults)

|-|-|
| Metric | Threshold |
| Pixel threshold | `0.1` (odiff default) |
| Antialiasing filter | `true` |
| ΔE color threshold | `2.0` |
| Convergence | `< 0.5%` diff AND zero blocker/major |
| Max iterations | `5` before asking user |

All overridable in `parity.rubric.yaml`.

## Apply → re-run

Process deltas in severity order (`blocker` → `major` → `minor` → `cosmetic`), then by category (structure first). Batch related fixes before re-screenshotting — post-per-fix captures are slow and obscure which edits worked.

Stop when **any** of:
- `diffPercentage < 0.5%` AND no blocker/major deltas
- User says "accept"
- Three iterations without meaningful improvement (ask user)

## Common failure modes

Top three — see `references/troubleshooting.md` for the full list:

1. **Every pixel different** — viewport, DPR, or font stack mismatch. Check the three values; web fonts not system fonts.
2. **Diff flips between states** — animations. `disable-animations` is on by default; check intersection-observer fade-ins.
3. **Claude fixes color but breaks layout** — wrong category order. Always process `structure` + `layout` before `color`.

## Constraints

- Never start servers. The dev server URL must already be reachable.
- Never edit target files. Targets are source of truth; only the implementation changes.
- Never resize images to force a viewport match.
- Never delete `.parity/`. It's the audit trail and the dependency cache.

## Output to user

After each iteration, print a concise summary (not the full JSON):

```
Iteration 2 of dashboard:
  Pixel diff:  2.3% → 0.8% (improved)
  Blockers:    1 → 0
  Major:       4 → 2
  Minor:       7 → 5

Remaining major:
  1. Sidebar collapse padding (4px too tight)
  2. Card shadow offset (target y=4, impl y=2)

Next: apply 2 fixes in fix_plan.json, re-run. ETA: 1-2 iterations.
```

Full JSON to `.parity/runs/<screen>/iteration_N/{deltas,fix_plan}.json`.
