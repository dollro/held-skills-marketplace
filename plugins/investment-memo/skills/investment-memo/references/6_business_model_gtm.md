## 6. Business Model & GTM

> **Assessment Pillar:** Business Model (commercial side) | **Weight:** Seed 10% / Series A 15%
>
> This chapter evaluates commercial viability through the **Strategyzer Innovation Framework** (Hitchins/IDEO): **Desirability** (Human — Do customers want it?), **Feasibility** (Technology & Operations — Can we deliver and sell it?), and **Viability** (Finances — Does the economics work at scale?). Each criterion maps to one of these three dimensions. The intersection of all three defines genuine innovation potential. Concentration risk is assessed as a cross-cutting red flag overlay across all dimensions rather than scored independently. The BCSA adoption framework (Better, Cheaper, Simpler, Available) has been elevated to the IC synthesis level for cross-cutting assessment across Chapters 5 and 6.
>
> **Deep-tech calibration note:** Unlike pure SaaS businesses, deep-tech ventures face fundamentally different commercial dynamics: longer sales cycles with multi-stakeholder procurement, hardware-software blended economics, regulatory and certification gating, and GTM strategies that often depend on OEM/system-integrator partnerships rather than direct sales. The criteria below are calibrated for these realities. Analysts should resist benchmarking deep-tech startups against SaaS-native metrics without appropriate adjustment.

---

### DESIRABILITY — "Do They Want It?"

> Does the target customer genuinely want this solution badly enough to change behavior, allocate budget, and commit engineering resources to integration? In deep-tech B2B, desirability extends beyond "would they buy it" to "will they re-engineer their workflow or production line around it."

#### 6.1 — Customer Demand & Market Traction 🚩 RED FLAG [0–5]

**Positive Hypothesis:** The product demonstrates visible product-market fit signals appropriate to investment stage — customer demand is not theoretical but evidenced through concrete buying behavior. The technical USP has been successfully translated into a clear, compelling customer value proposition that resonates with the ICP. The solution addresses specific, quantifiable pain points (painkillers) or delivers measurable value creation (gain creators) that the ICP can articulate in their own language. Customers validate the value proposition through stage-appropriate evidence: at minimum, pilot commitment with defined success criteria; ideally, pilot-to-production conversion and expansion signals.

**How to assess (junior analyst checklist):**

**PMF Signal Assessment:**
- Apply the "Sean Ellis Test" proxy: Ask customers directly: "How would you feel if you could no longer use this product?" If >40% say "very disappointed," this indicates emerging PMF. For deep-tech B2B, modify to: "Would you re-engineer your production process around this solution?" and "What would you use if this company disappeared tomorrow?"
- Track PMF progression signals by stage:

| Stage | Early PMF Signals | Strong PMF Signals |
|-------|------------------|-------------------|
| Pre-Seed | ICP articulates pain in their words, requests product features | ICP offers co-development resources, commits engineering time |
| Seed | Paid pilots with defined success criteria, organic inbound interest | Pilot-to-production conversion, customer willing to be reference |
| Series A | Production deployments, expansion within accounts | Multi-year contracts, customer-funded feature development, word-of-mouth referrals |

- Assess demand quality: Is demand "pulled" by customers (inbound inquiries, referrals, customers seeking out the company) or "pushed" by sales effort (cold outreach, heavy founder selling)? Pulled demand is the strongest PMF signal.
- Watch for false PMF signals: Innovation theater (customers interested in "learning about AI/tech" but no production intent), free pilot accumulation without conversion, excessive customization demands (product-market mismatch), or interest only from innovation labs without operational buyer engagement.

**Technical USP → Customer Value Proposition Translation:**
- Ask founders: "Describe your product in the words your customers use, not your technical terms." A mature company can articulate the value proposition without reference to underlying technology — "we reduce scrap rate by 40%" not "we use computer vision with proprietary neural architecture."
- Test the value proposition clarity: Can a junior analyst summarize why the customer buys in one sentence? If the value proposition requires explaining the technology, the translation is incomplete.
- Identify the "so what?" chain: Technical capability → Operational impact → Financial outcome. Example: "Real-time defect detection (tech) → Catch defects before assembly (operational) → Save €500K/year in scrap and rework (financial)." All three links must be present and validated.

**Painkiller/Gain Creator Assessment:**
- Classify the value proposition:

| Value Type | Description | Validation Method | VC Attractiveness |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Painkiller (critical)** | Solves urgent, high-consequence problem | Customer can quantify cost of inaction | Highest |
| **Painkiller (operational)** | Removes friction, reduces cost/time | Before/after metrics available | High |
| **Gain Creator (strategic)** | Enables new capability or market access | Customer can describe opportunity unlocked | Medium-High |
| **Gain Creator (incremental)** | Improves existing metric marginally | Difficult to isolate impact | Lower |

- For painkillers: What happens if the customer does NOT solve this problem? Quantify the consequence — regulatory fine, production downtime cost, safety incident liability, lost revenue from quality failures, manual labor cost. The annual cost of inaction establishes the value ceiling.
- For gain creators: What new capability does the customer gain? Can they access a new market, offer a new product, or achieve a strategic objective that was previously impossible? Gain creators require stronger proof of adoption intent.
- Validate with customers directly: "Why are you evaluating this solution now? What triggered the evaluation?" Urgent triggers (audit finding, competitor pressure, new regulation, production crisis) indicate painkiller; discretionary triggers ("exploring efficiency improvements") indicate vitamin risk.

**ICP Resonance Validation:**
- Confirm the value proposition resonates specifically with the defined ICP (see 6.2), not just generically with "potential customers."
- Ask: "Which customer segment responds most enthusiastically? Which is hardest to convert?" The answer reveals whether the value proposition is tuned to the right ICP.
- Cross-reference customer reference calls: Do customers describe the value in consistent terms that match the company's positioning? Inconsistent value articulation across customers suggests unclear positioning or product-market mismatch.

> *Red Flag triggers: No paying pilot customer despite >12 months of sales effort. No evidence of customer demand beyond founder-initiated conversations. Technical USP cannot be translated into customer-relevant value proposition. Customers cannot articulate the problem solved in their own words. Multiple pivots in value proposition without traction improvement.*
>
> *Stage note: At Seed, PMF signals are necessarily early — focus on quality of customer engagement and progression velocity rather than volume. At Series A, PMF should be evidenced through production deployments and expansion signals, not just pilots.*
>
> *Scoring guidance: Score reflects the weaker of (a) PMF signal strength and (b) value proposition clarity. Score 5 if strong PMF signals are present for stage, technical USP translates into a crisp customer value proposition, and customers validate painkiller-level pain with quantifiable impact. Score 2–3 if PMF signals are early but progressing appropriately, value proposition is clear but not yet validated through production deployment, or value type is gain creator rather than painkiller. Score 0–1 if no credible PMF signals exist, value proposition is technology-centric with no customer translation, or the solution is a discretionary vitamin with no urgency driver.*

#### 6.2 — ICP & GTM Strategy [0–5]

**Positive Hypothesis:** The Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) is precisely defined with specificity on firmographics, pain intensity, buying behavior, and accessibility. The company can identify named accounts that match the ICP and explain why these customers will buy faster, pay more, and retain longer than non-ICP customers. The go-to-market strategy is tightly aligned to the ICP — channel selection, messaging, pricing, and sales motion are all optimized for the defined ICP, not generically for "the market." The GTM strategy is executable given the team's capabilities and the company's runway, with a credible path from current customer acquisition to a scalable, repeatable motion.

**How to assess (junior analyst checklist):**

**ICP Definition Quality:**
- Request the written ICP definition. Evaluate specificity across dimensions:

| ICP Dimension | Weak Definition | Strong Definition |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Industry/Vertical** | "Manufacturing" | "Automotive Tier 1 suppliers, metal stamping, €100M-500M revenue" |
| **Pain Intensity** | "They want to improve quality" | "They face €2M+ annual scrap cost, have failed prior solutions, face OEM audit pressure" |
| **Buying Behavior** | "They buy software" | "VP Ops controls budget, CapEx threshold €200K, 9-month procurement cycle, require on-site pilot" |
| **Accessibility** | "We can reach them" | "CTO attends Hannover Messe, active in VDMA working groups, founder has 3 warm intros" |
| **Success Predictors** | Not defined | "Best customers have: dedicated quality team, existing MES system, prior CV/AI projects" |

- Ask: "Which customers will NOT buy from you, even if they have the problem?" The ability to articulate anti-ICP criteria indicates mature segmentation.
- Test ICP validation: Can the founders identify 50 named accounts that match the ICP criteria? Have they contacted at least 20? What is the conversion rate for ICP-match vs. non-ICP customers?
- Assess ICP evolution: Has the ICP narrowed or pivoted based on market learning? A static ICP since founding suggests insufficient market engagement; excessive pivots suggest lack of clarity.

**GTM Strategy Assessment:**
- Map the GTM strategy to the ICP:

| GTM Element | Assessment Question | ICP Alignment Test |
|------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Channel** | Direct sales, partners, PLG, hybrid? | Does the channel match how the ICP buys? |
| **Messaging** | What's the lead message? | Does it address the ICP's specific pain in their language? |
| **Pricing** | What's the pricing model? | Is it aligned with ICP budget cycles and procurement preferences? |
| **Sales motion** | High-touch enterprise, mid-touch, self-serve? | Is it appropriate for ICP deal size and complexity? |
| **Entry point** | How do you get the first meeting? | Do you have access to the ICP's attention? |

- Ask founders: "Walk me through your last 3 won deals and your last 3 lost deals." Analyze: Were won deals ICP-match? Were lost deals non-ICP or execution failures? This reveals GTM effectiveness and ICP validity.
- Evaluate GTM channel fit for deep-tech: Direct enterprise sales requires domain credibility and long runway; partner/OEM channel requires relationship development and value-share negotiation; product-led growth rarely works for complex B2B deep-tech (long evaluation cycles, high-touch deployment).

**GTM Executability:**
- Assess commercial team capacity: Who is executing the GTM today? Founders only? First sales hire? What is the realistic customer acquisition capacity given current resources?
- Calculate GTM math: (Sales cycle length × monthly burn) vs. (pipeline × expected close rate × deal value). Is the GTM strategy executable before runway exhaustion?
- Identify the GTM scaling trigger: What must be true before the company invests in scaling the sales team? (e.g., "repeatable sales playbook validated by first non-founder sales hire closing deals independently").
- For founder-led sales stage: Is there a concrete plan to transition from founder-led to team-driven sales? Is the transition budgeted and timed? What is the target profile for first sales hire?

**GTM-ICP Coherence:**
- Cross-check: Does every GTM element serve the defined ICP, or is the company attempting to serve multiple segments with inconsistent GTM motions?
- Red flag: "We're pursuing both enterprise OEMs and SME manufacturers" with a single GTM motion. These require fundamentally different sales motions, pricing, and positioning.
- Positive signal: Tight focus — "We're only pursuing automotive Tier 1s for the next 18 months. We'll expand to Tier 2s after we've established reference cases."

> *Deep-tech reality check: In industrial B2B, ICP precision drives capital efficiency. A startup chasing "anyone who will buy" burns cash on poor-fit customers with long sales cycles and high churn. The best deep-tech companies are ruthlessly focused on a narrow ICP where they can win repeatedly.*
>
> *Stage note: At Seed, ICP may still be hypothesis-driven, but the company should have a clear testing methodology and be converging toward definition. At Series A, ICP should be validated through customer evidence and the company should be able to identify 100+ named accounts that match the profile.*
>
> *Scoring guidance: Score 5 if ICP is precisely defined with validated criteria, GTM strategy is tightly aligned to ICP with demonstrated conversion, and the team has commercial capacity to execute the strategy within runway. Score 2–3 if ICP is reasonably defined but still being refined, GTM strategy is logical but not yet validated at scale, or commercial capacity is constrained but scaling plan exists. Score 0–1 if ICP is vague or undefined ("we sell to manufacturing companies"), GTM strategy is generic or misaligned with ICP buying behavior, or the company lacks commercial capacity to execute.*

---

### FEASIBILITY — "Can We Deliver & Sell It?"

> Can the company operationally deliver the solution at the quality level required by industrial customers, scale technology from lab to production, and position itself within the industry ecosystem? For deep-tech, feasibility extends beyond "can we sell it" to "can we manufacture, certify, industrialize, and support it at production scale?"

#### 6.3 — Business Model Execution [0–5]

**Positive Hypothesis:** The company demonstrates credible execution capability across the full business model — not just sales and customer acquisition, but technology industrialization, manufacturing scale-up, and operational delivery. For deep-tech, the path from lab prototype to production-grade product is concrete and budgeted, with design-for-manufacturability (DFM), design-to-cost (DTC), and production quality assurance addressed explicitly. The team has or is building the operational capabilities required to deliver at scale, with realistic cost-down trajectories and manufacturing partnerships or internal capacity plans in place.

**How to assess (junior analyst checklist):**

**Technology Industrialization Readiness:**
- Assess the "lab-to-fab" gap: Where is the technology on the industrialization spectrum?

| Industrialization Stage | Evidence | Key Risks |
|------------------------|----------|-----------|
| **Lab prototype** | Works in controlled conditions with manual intervention | Yield, reproducibility, environmental sensitivity |
| **Engineering prototype** | Repeatable performance, documented process | Manufacturing cost, cycle time, component availability |
| **Pilot production** | Small batch manufacturing, process documented | Yield at scale, supplier qualification, quality consistency |
| **Production-ready** | Qualified manufacturing process, yield >90% | Scaling capacity, cost-down execution |

- Ask: "What breaks when you go from producing 10 units to 1,000 units?" The answer reveals industrialization maturity. Founders who haven't thought through this question are underestimating scale-up complexity.
- For hardware+software: Assess both dimensions. Software industrialization includes: deployment automation, monitoring/observability, update mechanisms, security hardening, customer-facing documentation.

**Design-for-Manufacturability (DFM) & Design-to-Cost (DTC):**
- Request the bill-of-materials (BOM) cost structure. Identify: What percentage of COGS is custom vs. commodity components? What components have single-source risk? What is the target BOM cost at 10x volume?
- Assess DTC discipline: Has the product been designed with cost targets in mind, or is it over-engineered for performance without cost consideration? Red flag: "We'll optimize cost later" — cost is designed in, not optimized out.
- Evaluate DFM: Has the company engaged manufacturing partners early in design? Are there design choices that will be expensive or impossible to manufacture at scale (exotic materials, tight tolerances, complex assembly sequences)?
- For deep-tech: Apply manufacturing readiness level (MRL) framework:

| MRL | Description | Series A Expectation |
|-----|-------------|---------------------|
| 1-3 | Manufacturing concepts identified | Pre-Seed |
| 4-5 | Production process validated in lab | Seed |
| 6-7 | Production demonstrated in pilot environment | Series A minimum |
| 8-9 | Production qualified, yield targets met | Growth stage |

**Operational Delivery Capability:**
- Map the delivery process end-to-end: Order → Manufacturing/procurement → Quality assurance → Shipping → Installation/deployment → Training → Support → Maintenance/updates. Who owns each step? What is the current capacity constraint?
- Assess operational scalability: Which elements of delivery scale with capital (manufacturing equipment, software infrastructure) vs. with headcount (field service, customer success)? Headcount-scaling elements limit margin expansion.
- For deep-tech requiring on-site deployment: What is the deployment time per customer? What drives deployment complexity (integration with existing systems, regulatory approval, customer training)? Can deployment be productized to reduce time and cost?

**Manufacturing & Supply Chain Strategy:**
- Identify the manufacturing model: In-house, contract manufacturing (CM), hybrid? Assess the fit:

| Model | Appropriate When | Risks |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| **In-house** | Core differentiation in manufacturing process, low volume/high mix | Capital intensity, operational distraction |
| **Contract manufacturing** | Standardized processes, need to scale quickly | Quality control, IP exposure, margin compression |
| **Hybrid** | Core process in-house, commodity assembly outsourced | Coordination complexity, supply chain fragility |

- If using CM: Which CM partners are engaged? What is the qualification status? Is there a backup CM identified and qualified? For deep-tech, CM selection is strategic — not all CMs can handle complex assemblies, exotic materials, or stringent quality requirements.
- Assess supply chain resilience: Identify critical-path components with >6-month lead time or single-source supply. What is the mitigation plan? This is especially critical post-2021 given ongoing supply chain disruptions.

**Execution Track Record:**
- Ask: "What was the last major operational milestone you hit on time and on budget? What was the last one you missed?" The answer reveals execution culture and forecasting accuracy.
- For Series A: Has the company demonstrated the ability to manufacture and deliver production-quality product to paying customers? If not, what specifically must be proven before production readiness?

> *Deep-tech reality check: Technology risk (Chapter 3) and business model execution risk are related but distinct. A technically successful lab demonstration is worthless if the company cannot industrialize it at viable cost. Many deep-tech ventures fail not because the technology doesn't work, but because they cannot manufacture it reliably, affordably, and at scale.*
>
> *Stage note: At Seed, industrialization can be a plan rather than demonstrated capability, but the plan must be realistic and the team must include or have access to manufacturing/operations expertise. At Series A, the company should have demonstrated at least pilot-scale production with a credible path to production scale-up.*
>
> *Scoring guidance: Score 5 if technology industrialization path is demonstrated through pilot production, DFM/DTC discipline is evident with realistic cost-down trajectory, manufacturing strategy is sound with partners engaged, and operational delivery has been validated at pilot scale. Score 2–3 if industrialization plan is credible but not yet demonstrated, DFM/DTC is in progress but cost targets are not yet validated, or manufacturing strategy exists but partnerships are not yet secured. Score 0–1 if industrialization path is unclear or underestimated, product is over-engineered without cost discipline, manufacturing strategy is absent or unrealistic, or the team lacks operational/manufacturing expertise.*

#### 6.4 — Strategic Partnerships & Ecosystem Position [0–5]

**Positive Hypothesis:** Strategic partnerships across the value chain — including customers, suppliers, technology partners, and ecosystem players — provide genuine acceleration through distribution, technology validation, manufacturing capability, or market access. The startup occupies a defensible position within the industry ecosystem, with partnerships that create mutual dependency rather than one-sided reliance. Supplier partnerships secure access to critical components or manufacturing capabilities. Ecosystem partnerships (research institutions, industry consortia, standards bodies) strengthen market position and technology credibility. Partnership structures preserve the startup's optionality and value capture potential.

**How to assess (junior analyst checklist):**

**Partnership Portfolio Assessment:**
- Map all strategic relationships by type:

| Partnership Type | Value Contribution | Key Assessment Questions |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| **Customer partners** | Revenue, market validation, co-development | Does the customer commit resources, not just interest? |
| **Supplier partners** | Component access, manufacturing capacity, cost advantage | Is access secured contractually? Is there pricing commitment? |
| **Technology partners** | Complementary capabilities, IP access, R&D leverage | Is the partnership exclusive? What IP sharing arrangements exist? |
| **Channel partners** | Distribution, market access, customer relationships | Who controls the customer relationship? What is the margin structure? |
| **Ecosystem partners** | Credibility, standards influence, network access | Does membership provide tangible commercial benefit? |

- For each claimed partnership: What is the contractual status (signed agreement / LOI / MoU / verbal / aspirational)? What specifically does each party commit to? Is the commitment enforceable?

**Strategic Supplier Partnerships:**
- Identify critical suppliers — those providing components or services that are essential, differentiated, or potentially single-sourced.
- Assess supplier partnership depth:

| Supplier Relationship Level | Characteristics |
|---------------------------|-----------------|
| **Transactional** | Standard terms, no volume commitment, commodity pricing |
| **Preferred** | Volume commitment, priority allocation, negotiated pricing |
| **Strategic** | Joint development, custom specifications, capacity reservation |
| **Exclusive** | Exclusive access to capability, joint IP, equity relationship |

- For strategic components: Does the startup have contractual supply agreements? Are there alternative suppliers qualified? What happens if the primary supplier cannot deliver?
- Deep-tech nuance: For novel deep-tech products, suppliers may need to develop new capabilities or processes. Assess whether the startup is working with suppliers who are willing and able to invest in the partnership.

**Technology & Ecosystem Partnerships:**
- Map technology partnerships: Research institutions (universities, Fraunhofer, etc.), technology licensors, complementary technology providers, system integrators.
- Assess the "credibility multiplier": Do partnerships with established institutions or companies de-risk the technology in the eyes of customers and investors? (e.g., joint development agreement with leading OEM, research collaboration with Max Planck, integration partnership with SAP)
- Evaluate ecosystem position: Is the startup participating in relevant industry consortia, standards bodies, or working groups? This participation builds credibility and market intelligence, especially in regulated industries where standards influence market adoption.
- For platform/integration plays: Assess integration partnership depth — deep technical integration (API access, joint development, co-selling) vs. shallow ("listed in marketplace, no active support").

**Value Chain Position & Control:**
- Map the startup's position in the industry value chain. Who is upstream (suppliers, technology providers)? Who is downstream (customers, channel partners, end users)?
- Assess control dynamics: At each value chain interface, who has leverage? A startup squeezed between powerful suppliers and powerful customers may struggle to capture value regardless of technology excellence.
- For OEM/embedding partnerships: Who controls the end-customer relationship? If the partner owns the customer, the startup becomes a component supplier with limited pricing power and no direct market feedback.
- Evaluate disintermediation risk: Could a powerful partner (supplier, customer, or ecosystem player) replicate the startup's offering or route around it? What contractual or technical protections exist?

**Partnership as Competitive Moat:**
- Apply the "would they notice?" test: Is the startup a strategic priority for the partner (dedicated resources, executive sponsorship, committed investment), or one of many innovation projects?
- Assess mutual dependency: Partnerships are most durable when both parties benefit significantly and switching costs are high. One-sided dependency (startup needs partner more than partner needs startup) creates fragility.
- Identify exclusive or preferential arrangements: Does the startup have first-mover, exclusive, or preferential access that competitors cannot easily replicate?

> *Deep-tech context: In industrial deep-tech, partnerships are often existential, not supplementary. A hardware startup without manufacturing partnerships cannot scale. A B2B startup without industry ecosystem credibility may be locked out of customer conversations. Evaluate partnerships as infrastructure, not optionality.*
>
> *Scoring guidance: Score 5 if partnerships are contractually secured with committed resources across multiple value chain positions (customer, supplier, ecosystem), mutual dependency is established, and the startup's value chain position is defensible with preserved optionality. Score 2–3 if partnerships are in development with LOIs or MoUs, supplier and ecosystem relationships are progressing but not yet secured, or partnership portfolio is reasonable but lacks depth or exclusivity. Score 0–1 if partnerships are purely aspirational, critical supplier relationships are not secured, or the startup is fully dependent on a single partner that controls key value chain positions.*

### VIABILITY — "Does the Math Work?"

> At scale, can this business generate attractive unit economics, capture value commensurate with its differentiation, and deliver VC-grade returns? For deep-tech, viability must account for hardware-software blended economics, manufacturing scale-up curves, and capital-intensity profiles fundamentally different from pure SaaS.

#### 6.5 — Value Capture & Pricing Power [0–5]

**Positive Hypothesis:** Pricing is anchored to quantified customer value delivered (value-based pricing), not cost-plus or market-reference. The revenue model supports compounding growth through a strong recurring component (SaaS subscription, usage-based, or maintenance/service contracts) with natural expansion mechanics within customer accounts. The company has genuine pricing power — customers would not switch to a 30% cheaper alternative, indicating differentiation beyond price. The 10x differentiation identified in criterion 5.2 translates into defensible value capture, with pricing that reflects delivered value rather than being driven by discount pressure, procurement squeeze, or OEM margin absorption.

**How to assess (junior analyst checklist):**

**Pricing Strategy & Value Anchoring:**
- Ask: "How did you set your price?" Value-based pricing (anchored to quantified customer benefit, e.g., "we reduce scrap rate by 40%, saving €500K/year, so we charge €50K") scores highest. Cost-plus ("our COGS is €X, we add a 60% margin") scores lower. Competitive reference ("we priced to match competitor Y") scores lowest.
- Calculate the **value capture ratio**: price charged ÷ quantified customer value delivered. Deep-tech startups typically capture 10–30% of the value they deliver. Below 10% indicates underpricing; above 30% requires exceptionally strong lock-in.
- Test pricing resilience: "If a competitor offered a 30% lower price, would you lose customers?" If yes, the company is competing on price (weak moat). If no, there's genuine differentiation and switching cost protection.

**Revenue Model Architecture:**
- Classify the revenue model and assess its recurring quality:

| Model Component | Recurring Quality | VC Attractiveness |
|---|---|---|
| SaaS subscription (platform access) | High | Highest |
| Usage-based (per-unit, per-scan, per-analysis) | Medium-High | High (if usage grows with customer) |
| Maintenance/support contracts | Medium | Medium-High |
| Consumables/reagents (razor-blade model) | Medium | High (if proprietary) |
| One-time hardware sale | None | Low (unless paired with above) |
| One-time license | None | Lowest |

- For hardware+software businesses: What is the ratio of one-time hardware revenue to recurring software/service revenue? Higher recurring ratio = higher enterprise value multiple at exit. Model the blended ratio at scale (year 3–5) — the initial ratio will be hardware-heavy; the mature ratio should shift toward recurring.
- Identify natural expansion mechanics: Does revenue grow within existing customers without proportional sales effort? (e.g., usage-based pricing that scales with production volume, seat-based expansion, additional deployment sites, upsell from monitoring to control).

**USP-to-Revenue Bridge (cross-reference with 5.2):**
- Cross-reference with 5.2 (10x Differentiation): Does the superior technical performance or cost advantage translate into pricing power, or is the company forced to compete on price despite superior performance?
- A low score here with a high 5.2 score is a critical warning signal: "great technology, broken business model." Common failure modes in deep-tech: the OEM partner captures most of the value; procurement departments commoditize the offering; the technical advantage isn't visible to the economic buyer.

> *Critical insight: A product can be 10x better (high score on 5.2) but still score low here if the value capture mechanism is broken. This is the "USP-to-revenue bridge" that many deep-tech ventures fail to cross. The failure is often structural, not execution-related: the startup's position in the value chain simply doesn't allow value capture commensurate with value creation.*
>
> *Scoring guidance: Score 5 if pricing is value-anchored with a clear value capture ratio, the revenue model has a strong recurring component with natural expansion mechanics, and pricing power is demonstrated through resilience against price competition. Score 2–3 if pricing logic is sound but untested at scale, the recurring revenue component exists but is a minority of total revenue, or pricing power is plausible but unproven. Score 0–1 if pricing is cost-plus or competitor-referenced with no value anchoring, the revenue model is entirely one-time with no recurring component, or the USP-to-revenue bridge is structurally broken (great technology, no monetization path).*

#### 6.6 — Unit Economics & Scalability [0–5]

**Positive Hypothesis:** Unit economics are healthy at current scale with a credible, substantiated path to improvement through cost reduction and operational leverage — not pricing increases. Gross margin expansion is driven by manufacturing cost-down curves (learning effects, volume discounts, BOM optimization), operational efficiency gains (deployment automation, support scalability), and fixed cost leverage. The business model exhibits clear operating leverage: revenue scales significantly faster than headcount and operational costs. At scale, the cost structure supports attractive contribution margins with capital efficiency that improves over time.

**How to assess (junior analyst checklist):**

**Current Unit Economics Baseline:**
- Request the founders' unit economics calculation. For deep-tech, ensure full cost loading:

| Cost Component | Often Underestimated | Full Loading Includes |
|---------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **COGS - Hardware** | BOM cost only | + Manufacturing overhead, yield loss, quality assurance, packaging, logistics |
| **COGS - Software** | Marginal cost = ~zero | + Cloud infrastructure, data storage, support tools |
| **Customer Acquisition** | Marketing + sales only | + Pre-sales engineering, pilot hardware/deployment, technical support during evaluation |
| **Deployment** | Not included | Installation, integration, training, customization, project management |
| **Customer Support** | Minimal estimate | Ongoing support, maintenance, updates, field service |

- Calculate fully-loaded unit economics:
  - **Gross margin** = (Revenue - fully-loaded COGS) / Revenue
  - **Contribution margin** = (Revenue - COGS - Direct customer costs) / Revenue
  - **LTV** = Average revenue per customer × Gross margin × Customer lifetime (years)
  - **Fully-loaded CAC** = Total customer acquisition spend including all pre-sales costs / Customers acquired

**Cost Reduction Trajectory:**
- Map the cost-down roadmap. For hardware deep-tech, costs typically improve through:

| Cost-Down Lever | Typical Impact | Timing |
|----------------|----------------|--------|
| **Manufacturing learning curve** | 10-20% per doubling of cumulative volume | Ongoing with production |
| **BOM optimization** | 15-30% through component redesign | 12-24 months post-production |
| **Volume discounts from suppliers** | 10-25% at scale commitments | Negotiated with growth |
| **Yield improvement** | Variable, can be substantial | Ongoing process optimization |
| **Design-to-cost iteration** | 20-40% through fundamental redesign | Major release cycles |

- Ask: "What is your target gross margin at 10x current volume? What specifically drives the improvement?" Probe each cost-down assumption for evidence — has the company achieved similar improvements in the past? Are supplier quotes supporting volume discount assumptions?
- Red flag: Cost-down assumptions based entirely on "at scale" projections without validated intermediate steps or comparable evidence.

**Operating Leverage Assessment:**
- Ask: "If you 10x revenue, what happens to your cost structure?" Evaluate each cost category:

| Cost Category | Scales with Revenue? | Operating Leverage |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Cloud/infrastructure** | Partially (efficiency gains possible) | Medium |
| **Manufacturing/COGS** | Yes, but learning curves help | Medium |
| **R&D** | Less than linearly if product stabilizes | High |
| **Sales & Marketing** | Depends on GTM efficiency | Variable |
| **Customer Success/Support** | Often linearly without automation | Low |
| **G&A** | Less than linearly at scale | High |
| **Field Service/Deployment** | Often linearly for complex deployments | Low |

- Identify the primary margin expansion drivers:
  - **Software revenue mix shift**: Hardware-heavy to software-recurring revenue shift improves blended margins
  - **Support scalability**: Self-service tools, knowledge base, community support reduce per-customer support cost
  - **Deployment productization**: Standardized deployment reduces integration time and cost
  - **Manufacturing efficiency**: Learning curve, yield improvement, automation reduce COGS

**Scalability Constraints & Bottlenecks:**
- Identify which elements of the business scale with capital vs. headcount:

| Scales with Capital | Scales with Headcount |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| Manufacturing capacity | Field deployment/installation |
| Cloud infrastructure | Customer success management |
| Software deployment | Pre-sales engineering (early stage) |
| Automated processes | Complex integration projects |

- For headcount-scaling elements: What is the plan to shift toward capital-scaling? (e.g., productized deployment, self-service onboarding, automated support, partner-delivered services)
- Calculate: What is the revenue-per-employee trajectory? At $1M revenue? $10M? $100M? Software companies should approach $300K+ revenue per employee at scale; hardware+software typically $200-300K. Below $150K indicates structural scalability issues.

**Capital Efficiency:**
- Calculate burn multiple: Net burn ÷ Net new ARR (or equivalent order book). Benchmark: <2.5x is efficient, >3.5x indicates capital inefficiency. For deep-tech pre-production, benchmark capital efficiency through milestone achievement per euro invested.
- Track the trend: Is capital efficiency improving (burn multiple decreasing) or deteriorating? For deep-tech, there is often a step-function improvement after first production deployment — assess whether this inflection is approaching.
- Assess the path to profitability: At what revenue level does the company reach cash flow breakeven? Is this achievable within plausible funding scenarios?

> *Deep-tech calibration: Pure SaaS benchmarks do not apply directly. A hardware+SaaS company with 45% blended gross margins and a clear trajectory to 55%+ at scale can be more attractive than a SaaS company with 70% margins but no defensibility. Evaluate the margin trajectory and the credibility of cost-down assumptions, not just the current snapshot.*
>
> *Stage note: At Seed, directional unit economics from first cohorts or comparable benchmarks are acceptable, with cost-down assumptions based on reasonable analogies. At Series A, validated unit economics with cohort data and a substantiated cost-down trajectory are expected.*
>
> *Scoring guidance: Score reflects the weaker of (a) current unit economics health, (b) cost-down trajectory credibility, and (c) operating leverage evidence. Score 5 if unit economics exceed sector-appropriate benchmarks, cost-down trajectory is substantiated with evidence or validated assumptions, and operating leverage is demonstrated or clearly achievable. Score 2–3 if unit economics meet minimum benchmarks, cost-down plan exists but is partially validated, or operating leverage is plausible but not yet demonstrated. Score 0–1 if unit economics are structurally negative with no credible cost-down path, gross margin improvement assumptions are unrealistic, or the business model requires linear headcount scaling with no path to leverage.*

### CROSS-CUTTING — Concentration Risk Red Flags

> Concentration risk is assessed across all three DVF dimensions as a cross-cutting vulnerability overlay. Rather than scoring independently, critical concentration risks trigger Red Flag assessment and inform the scoring of the criteria above. Any single-point-of-failure exceeding 30% exposure in any dimension warrants explicit documentation and mitigation assessment.

| Dependency Type | DVF Dimension | Key Question | Red Flag Threshold |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Customer** | Desirability | Would losing the top customer eliminate >30% of revenue/pipeline? | >50% revenue from single customer |
| **ICP segment** | Desirability | Is the entire value proposition tied to a single industry vertical? | 100% ICP concentration with no diversification path |
| **Manufacturing partner** | Feasibility | Is there a single contract manufacturer with no backup? | Single EMS/foundry with no alternative qualified |
| **Supplier / component** | Feasibility | Is a critical component single-sourced with no substitute? | Single-source component, >6-month lead time |
| **Channel / distribution** | Feasibility | Does the entire GTM depend on one distribution partner? | >70% of pipeline through one channel partner |
| **Technology licensor** | Feasibility | Does the product depend on a third-party license that could be revoked? | Core functionality dependent on revocable license |
| **Key person (commercial)** | All | Does one person hold all customer relationships? | All major accounts tied to one individual |

**Assessment guidance:**
- For each dependency dimension, calculate the concentration percentage. Document any dimension where a single entity represents >30% exposure.
- For identified concentrations: Is there a documented mitigation plan? What is the timeline to diversify?
- Customer concentration nuance: At Seed stage, 50–80% customer concentration is expected and acceptable if the anchor customer validates the market and the pipeline shows diversification intent. At Series A, >50% single-customer dependency is a structural risk. Duration and contractual commitment matter.
- Manufacturing/supplier concentration: For hardware deep-tech, identify the critical-path components. Are backup suppliers qualified and contractually engaged? Is the startup designing for manufacturability with multiple potential suppliers, or locked into a single vendor's proprietary process?
- For key person risk (commercial): Who holds the customer relationships? Is there a succession/knowledge transfer plan? This risk is highest at the founder-led sales stage and should diminish as the commercial team scales.

> *Concentration risk does not score independently but directly informs criteria scores above: customer/ICP concentration impacts 6.1 and 6.2; manufacturing/supplier concentration impacts 6.3 and 6.6; channel/distribution concentration impacts 6.4; technology licensor risk impacts 6.4 and 6.5.*

### Chapter 6 — Red Flags (automatic Pass triggers):

- 🚩 No visible PMF signals and no evidence of customer demand beyond founder-initiated conversations (Desirability failure — 6.1)
- 🚩 Technical USP cannot be translated into customer value proposition; customers cannot articulate problem solved (Desirability failure — 6.1)
- 🚩 ICP undefined or so broad as to be meaningless; GTM strategy misaligned with target customer buying behavior (Desirability failure — 6.2)
- 🚩 No credible path to technology industrialization; team lacks manufacturing/operations expertise with no plan to acquire (Feasibility failure — 6.3)
- 🚩 Complete dependence on a single partner that controls critical value chain position (customer access, manufacturing, supply), with no contractual protection or diversification path (Feasibility failure — 6.4)
- 🚩 Revenue model entirely dependent on one-time sales with no recurring component and no repeat purchase dynamic (Viability failure — 6.5)
- 🚩 Unit economics structurally negative with no credible cost-down path to positive contribution margin (Viability failure — 6.6)
- 🚩 Critical single-point-of-failure dependency without mitigation: single customer >50% of revenue at Series A, single manufacturer with no qualified alternative, or single-source critical component with no substitute (Concentration Risk — cross-cutting)
